# success_criteria allows additional conditions to be met before the subfolder is added to the catalog. E.g.,

#   manifest_file: Add the path if it contains a .manifest file
#   manifest_file_with_replacement: If a manifest file is found, replace it with an _SUCCESS file. Then add it to catalog.
#   { min_files: 100 }: Add the path if it contains at-least this many files.
#   { min_age: 3600 }: Add the path if the newest file is at least this many seconds old.
#   null: If the subfolder exists, the path gets added. Good for crawling historical data.
